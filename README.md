# Smart City Hack case
During the [Smart City Hackathon](https://smartcityhack.ru),  

team **KORUM** solved the case provied by Ministry of Construction Industry, Housing and Utilities Sector.  

MVP can read verified data from IoT sensors placed on either water, electric energy or gas meters. The data is being placed into the IPFS storage, and secured by placing its IPFS hash into the [Substrate Runtime](https://docs.substrate.dev/docs/architecture-of-a-runtime) storage. Diffrent Runtimes could be implemeted for various meters types, tariffs, or supplyer business and accounting logic. By automating reading of metering devices of housing and communal services, securing its storage and transportation to the accounting and control services, this solution provides sufficient ecomonic value for both customer and provider.

The solution is built on top of [Polkadot Substrate](https://docs.substrate.dev/), [IPFS](https://ipfs.io/) and [AIRALab's Robonomics](https://github.com/airalab/substrate-node-robonomics) technologies.
